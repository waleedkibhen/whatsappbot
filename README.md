# WhatsApp Facebook Video Downloader

A simple WhatsApp bot built with `whatsapp-web.js` that downloads Facebook videos (including Reels) and sends them back to the user.

## ✨ New Update
- **No Trigger Word Needed**: Gone are the days of typing `waiz`. Just send a Facebook link, and the bot will start downloading immediately!
- **Fast Downloading**: Uses a headless browser to fetch the best possible quality.

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Add your phone number to the `AUTHORIZED_NUMBERS` array in `index.js`.
2. Send a Facebook video link or a Reels link (e.g., `https://www.facebook.com/...` or `https://fb.watch/...`).
3. Wait for the bot to process and send the video back to you.

## 🛠️ Installation
